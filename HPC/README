To submit jobs to the HPC cluster you will need to log into one of the 
cluster submit systems. These systems are:

	submit-em64t-01.hpc.engr.oregonstate.edu
	submit-em64t-02.hpc.engr.oregonstate.edu
	submit-em64t-03.hpc.engr.oregonstate.edu
	submit-amd64-01.hpc.engr.oregonstate.edu

The commands you will need to master first are:

	qstat	used to check the status of a job,
		a queue, or all queues

	qsub	used to submit jobs to the cluster

	qdel	used to kill a running job

You can check syntax requirements for these and other commands by using
the 'man' command. ie man qstat or man qsub

There is also a web page for the cluster at:

	http://engr.oregonstate.edu/computing/cluster

The Users-Guide.pdf in this directory provides a great deal more information.
